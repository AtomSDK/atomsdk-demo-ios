 * @property useSmartConnect
 * @discussion Set this property to TRUE for countries that supports advanced mechanism of VPN Dialing on our network. This method of dialing will help in establishing a VPN Tunnel, quicker than the conventional (and recommended) method.
 
 How to get countries those support advanced mechanism of VPN Dialing?
 To get the list of countries those support advanced dialing mechanism use SDK method getCountriesForSmartDialing.
 
 Important:
 1. Setting this Parameter to TRUE, will override UseOptimized (if used). This means that UsedOptimization and UseSmartDialing cannot work together and overrides each other properties.
 
 2. This mechanism only works with countries those supports advanced dialing mechanism, this means, this property can only be used when VPNProperties is being initialized with Country and Protocol.
